This CD contains a collection of 67 digitized
radiographs from a round robin test on flaw
recognition in welding seams.

The films have been scanned with the scanner
LS85 SDR from Lumisys, mostly in high density mode.
The original 12 bit data depth was rescaled to
8 bits with a limear LUT proportional to optical film density
by visual adjustment to the image content. This ensures that all necessary
flaw information is still in the 8 bit images.

The pixel size is 40,3 micron (630 dpi).
The image file format is TIFF without compression.
The images are 8 bit gray values.

The file real-values.xls contains the true data and the flaw designations according to ISO 6520 and ISO 5817.
These true data have been generated using weld sections of 1 cm width starting from the indicated Zero point.

The images are the property of BAM Berlin and provided free of charge for scientific usage,
please do not forget to mention this when you are publishing work using this data set.
Any commercial usage is prohibited.

To view these images on a PC please use the program 
ISee! (see http://dir.bam.de/ic). With a profile plot window you are able
to calibrate the x- and y-axis and to measure the size
of any flaw indication.
