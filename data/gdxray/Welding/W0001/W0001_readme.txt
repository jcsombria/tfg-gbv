Series W0001 is a subset of 10 X-ray images that have been selected from series W0003. 

Series W0002 is the ideal segmentation of W0001, that is a set of binary images. In a binary image a pixel = ‘1’ is defect and a pixel = ‘0’ is no-defect. This ideal segmentation was performed manually, for this reason it is not perfect.

X-ray images from W0003 were taken by BAM (the original X-ray images acquired by BAM are compressed in RRT01.zip and RRT02.zip in folder W0003). More details about how the images were taken please see in W0003 the files ‘real-values.xls’ and ‘original_readme.txt’. For further questions you may contact Dr. Uwe Zscherpel from BAM <uwe.zscherpel@bam.de>.
